    Niche micro-Saases
1. The past two years have been a huge revenue opportunity for SaaS companies as businesses have had to pivot from mostly on-site teams to people working from home across many locations. Cloud-based tools were the logical answer – and many companies have profited big time. But as more solutions come to market, it becomes more difficult to get a piece of the pie.

In the future, one-size-fits-all software solutions will mostly belong to the industry’s biggest players. The lucrative future of SaaS for everyone else lies in creating highly specialized software designed to address very specific needs. In order to compete in what is becoming an increasingly over-saturated market, we’ll see SaaS trends in which savvy developers will cater to micro-niches. As a result, we’ll see more micro-apps aimed at meeting the precise requirements of narrow subsets of users in specific industries.

2. Overcomplicating and adding dozens of features and control buttons don’t work anymore. People don’t want every aspect of their life/business optimized, they want focus and smaller niche products to do the job.
If you want a landing page, it’s irrational to go and learn Bubble or Webflow. Although they are fantastic at doing what they do, when you want to open a little coffee subscription business, you need a landing page to be recognizable and serve its purpose. Better yet, if the builder provides specific nooks for coffee fans.
Although there’s a never-ending debate about a smaller market for vertical SaaS, then again, the advantages are great. For one, there’s a lower price CAC and less marketing spending. 
In vertical SaaS, you don’t expect to win everybody in the space but you do need to develop a pool of ambassadors that love and nurture your product. These fans offer exclusive and very focused insights into their needs. On the other hand, the churn in these businesses is usually very minimal.
3. Tailored Saas is split into two types: micro Saas and vertical Saas. Both these types  are cloud apps that address a single industry such as retail, education or healthcare.
The continuous growth of tailored Saas affects users and developers directly. Users will be investing in Saas apps that are created for their needs in a specific manner. Also, Saas developers will start tailoring their apps to benefit from the demand and satisfy a niche and even more specific, a micro niche. 
Micro Saas gained a lot of interest among small companies and teams as the searches for this type of software grew by 566% in 5 years.
A micro Saas app is a form of vertical Saas app made to meet even more particular needs. For instance, you might have a vertical Saas app for education in general, but you might also need a micro app for kindergartens, another one for high-school education, and so on.
Why it matters: Users expect Saas apps to address their specific needs which offers new opportunities for developers to create software that meets these market demands.


AI
If you haven’t heard of ChatGPT by now, you probably live in a sealed barrel underground. It has taken every news and social media outlet by storm, leaving no one behind and disrupting every industry on the way.
From the hysterics of whether or not it’ll take all our jobs away to a more conscious approach where the creative mind behind the AI capabilities is not overlooked,  we’ve seen it all in a matter of a couple of weeks. And it can only mean one thing: AI is no longer something people are trying in a lab—it’s coming into our lives and, inevitably, into pretty much every business.
Software development platforms, obviously, took it to a new level first. But SaaS is not far behind offering all kinds of outstanding advantages to its users. 
The capabilities of AI seem endless, from optimizing business processes to automating redundant tasks. However, the utilization of those capabilities is only starting, and it’s a fraction of what it could become. AI has been causing changes in the SaaS industry since 2017, taking baby steps, and now it’s ready for the big leap.
More artificial intelligence (AI) in customer relationship management (CRM)
With the more widespread use of SaaS products come larger datasets that can be used to improve algorithms and improve the accuracy of AI. The pandemic caused major disruptions to the customer service status quo. Companies have had to adapt to these new customer demands in order to stay competitive and maintain their market shares. As companies strive to provide best-in-class service, there’s a huge opportunity to use predictive behavior analysis to automate CRM, improve personalization, sharpen customer segmentation, and better identify customers who are ready to churn. Better AI capabilities will enable companies to automate redundant tasks, improve response times, provide better self-service support tools, reduce customer support costs – and provide better service. That’s why we’ve chosen it as the fifth of our SaaS industry trends for 2023.

Machine learning 
Along with analytic software are powering the artificial intelligence industry and they started to become important trends for the Saas market as well. Machine learning and analytic software are based on the idea of automation, which means that the program does a certain task automatically, without the help of the user.

Incorporating machine learning into Saas apps reduces the need of other features as the app will adjust its interface according to the customers’ behavior. “My Starbucks Barista” is a telling example of how machine learning can personalize an app, according to its user.

The automation feature of machine learning can reduce costs since chatbots can replace human responders to basic questions customers might have.

Analytic software is an efficient solution for Saas providers as it helps predict the users’ behavior. Such predictions and analysis help the providers to be proactive rather than reactive to churn and user disengaging behavior.

Thanks to its important benefits, machine learning is also known as a separate branch of Saas, MLaaS (Machine Learning as a Service). MLaaS offers tools such as language processing, face recognition, API’s and predictive analytics. The MLaaS market is estimated to reach $19.86 billion in 2025 from only $1.07 billion in 2016.

Why it matters: Machine learning and MLaaS will be the next big factor that companies will have to consider to remain successful competitors in the market. 


Artificial intelligence itself isn’t a new SaaS trend since AI has been used since 2007 to generate written content mainly for financial reports, databases and data insights. But nowadays AI also can create written content for social media, emails and blogs. Over 84% of marketing leaders use AI in their content marketing software. 

Saas providers use AI in their solutions that can write, rephrase, and generate SEO-optimized content. They can also choose to use AI for the emails that aim to improve user retention such as welcome emails, thank you emails, newsletters or feedback request emails.

Why it matters: Artificial Intelligence opens a way for the emergence of new tech-savvy types of SaaS solutions that have never existed before.



Low-code
Low-code is often confused with no-code and perceived as a drag-and-drop solution that doesn’t require any technical skills whatsoever. In this particular case, low code means “less code” and is a solution that gives immediate advantages to software developers, ridding them of redundant tasks and allowing them to focus on business logic. 
SMEs have picked up on the advantages and lower costs of low-code development becoming one of the fastest adopters of the technology. And since low-code development is progressing far beyond app development, the increase in demand for it is inevitable.
Limited financing no longer means slower or less functional technology. And with the growing number of deployment and integration options, scalability is less and less of an issue.
As classic as coding is for creating a new program or app, there is a low-code and even no-code technology that could ease the process even more. These platforms affected a lot of industries – that’s what distinguishes this SaaS trend among others. 
Developers with minimal and even no coding knowledge or experience can create apps no code nowadays. The value of the low-code market is estimated to reach $187 billion by 2030. It is expected that companies will create 70% of their apps on low-code or no-code platforms by 2025, compared to 25% in 2020.
Saas providers who choose to use a low-code or no-code platform will be able to develop their SaaS ideas even without any technological expertise. Low-code platforms support enthusiasts in building apps with visual programming which is a drag-and-drop interface for coding. There are plenty of SaaS examples that were built with no-code platforms such as Webflow.
Why it matters: Low-code and no-code opens the way for rapid startup development even for people without technological experience but with a great SaaS idea. 
 Low-code is a method of designing and developing applications using intuitive graphical tools and built-in features that reduce traditional (professional) code-writing requirements. Professional programming remains part of the process, but low-code development supports an augmented and simplified experience that ordinary users can quickly master. 
The low-code platform market will continue to evolve in the future. In 2022, its annual growth is estimated at $21.2 billion, which is 40%. A product manager from Zoho Creator, Tejas Gadhia, mentions that most of the productivity tools for employees will be low-code. By the way, low-code platforms are beneficial for developers to create drag-and-drop interfaces and integrations flawlessly. High productivity and faster iteration are among the numerous benefits low-code platforms deliver. Here are several examples of low-code platforms as a service used by companies to optimize their working operations:


Extreme transparency through content
Launching a SaaS is easier than ever before. No-code, low-code, and cloud platforms give you a chance to successfully implement your solution in a fraction of the time. The hardest part, though, is yet on you. Getting people to know about your product is hard and often takes a lot more dedication than building a product itself. 
Spend all your marketing budget (if it even exists) on social media ads? Seems like a great idea, but can you picture people clicking on a no-name brand ad? The price for a campaign can drown your funds very quickly and be a total miss after all.
To add, blind outreach on LinkedIn is simply bad manners.
Community is the new holy grail for the founders, and building in public is a trend that won’t go away in the nearest future. 
Building in public and sharing every step of your journey can build trust and generate the buzz you need to get the first customers. Having several tiers to this strategy can also add a feeling of ownership and value to your users.
There’s no need to sugarcoat your journey, too. 2022 has proven that people are hungry for real stories, and want to see a person behind the business more than ever. Everyone wants proof that you’re not a robot shipping 100 features a week and living a full life while raising a family and saving turtles on tropical islands. Showing vulnerability makes you oh-so relatable and makes people want to support you and your work.
There are a ton of different formats you can play with when implementing this: articles, screencasts, screenshots, tweets and threads, photos, and much more. Find the ones that work for you and be real.

Integrations
With the rise of remote job opportunities, one thing has become clear - we need a better solution to keep track of all the content and data we have on hand. It’s often scattered in 100 different places, and getting to the bottom of it is a task nobody wants to deal with.
Create a tool that allows you to monitor all the data movements, see who’s responsible for which document, and how to get access to it, and you’re golden.
We no longer want to choose and have one or the other. If it’s a file-sharing tool, let it cover everything from sharing passwords to documents to entire folders and see what exactly has been changed and by whom.
Zapier took the integration game to a whole new level, and the SaaS task is to keep up.
Customer brand + employer brand
Employees are empowered more than ever. 2 years of working from home showed no drop in productivity and, actually, even increased it for some industries. Everyone now advocates for more flexibility, cutting time for commuting, and better work-life balance. And employers are recognizing these claims and using them as leverage for creating more employee-friendly brands. 
According to Bloomberg - “Remote job posts draw more than half of all applications”.
(Source: https://snip.ly/7zfb8m) But a great employer brand is much more than just offering a remote setup. It’s about culture, trust, a feeling of ownership, and leveraging employees' strengths to create truly powerful teams. 
The future of work is finally entering every workspace and virtually “planting” diversity ideas doesn’t cut it. People are looking for truly integrated and diverse setups where they can feel comfortable and thrive. It also means creative adaptability where management takes trends and development seriously trying new tools and exploring personalized development opportunities.

More Content Marketing
1. In the over-saturated SaaS marketplace, visibility is the key to future profitability. While SaaS is a crowded market, this presents outstanding marketing opportunities for companies developing micro-niche products, which will have lower competition for important and highly relevant keyword rankings.

Savvy companies wanting to cement their position as players in the future of SaaS will invest in content marketing. Compared to cost-per-click (CPC) advertising, content marketing can deliver outstanding ROI for small niche SaaS companies while helping to build their credibility as providers of highly specialized software solutions that understand their users’ needs. Investing in evergreen content will drive organic traffic month after month – without the recurring expense of CPC campaigns.

Need more convincing? Currently, only 11% of SaaS companies are using content marketing. This is an excellent opportunity for astute companies – even those in highly competitive areas of the industry – to become first movers and jump onto one of the most profitable trends in SaaS since the early days of the 2020 remote-work boom. That’s why content marketing will be one of the most important SaaS industry trends of 2023.

2. Sales companies as well as growing brands, need SEO services to grow on top of google search results, increase agency sales and attract more clients. The past half a decade was decisive in the importance of SEO for Saas since the price of client acquisition went up by 40% while the interest in paying for it went down 70%. In this background, Saas SEO came as an affordable solution since it brings your website to the top of search engines, with less investment.

By investing in SEO, Saas providers can attract more potential users, as search engine optimization can bring up to 68% organic traffic. However, only 11% of Saas developers choose to invest in content marketing. This offers plenty of opportunities for Saas companies to get noticed on the market. By creating quality content that is properly optimized, your website will have more traffic and more customers. Quality content doesn’t mean just text as it can also be videos, webinars, templates and even ebooks.

Why it matters: It reduces dependency on paid ads and generates constant flow of traffic over time with minimum to no paid ads.  


Usage- and Value-Based Pricing
Recent SaaS trends relating to successful business models have moved toward higher-volume, lower-priced solutions than in years past. Many of today’s SaaS products are based on a self-service business model in which potential buyers purchase online without having any personal contact with the company itself. While this is an extremely cost-efficient way of selling subscriptions, it also reduces SaaS products to a commodity, which erodes brand loyalty and increases the likelihood that customers will jump ship for a cheaper option.

Smart SaaS companies understand that these days their buyers hold most of the power. With inflation at record highs and an uncertain economy, one of the most important 2023 SaaS trends will see a shift toward usage- and value-based pricing models. With shrinking profits, SaaS buyers are hesitant to lock themselves into a contract for a product that they may or may not use – and which may or may not deliver the expected ROI. In response, the financial future of SaaS lies in pricing models in which users pay an amount in proportion to the value they’ve derived from the software. Customers are less likely to churn if they’re getting what they perceive to be a good value for money with little risk.

User retention
User retention is the continuity with which customers keep using a certain product, in this case a Saas app. While user retention measures the clients that keep using a Saas app, churn is measuring the clients who stop using the same app.

The SaaS trend of increasing user retention is based on a decrease of churn. Saas companies implement user retention methods such as annual billing, notifications regarding new features or better customer service. A desirable user retention rate for Saas companies is equal or higher than 35% over a period of 8 weeks.

However, traditional ways like thank you and welcome emails, guides, and how-to articles to keep user retention aren’t enough nowadays. Nowadays, users expect more personalization in everything: industry-focused templates of a SaaS solution, webinars, master-classes, constantly updating best practices, courses, and video tutorials, and even personalized welcome videos. 

Why it matters: SaaS providers have to invest into new ways of keeping user retention rate at the desired level. Without these investments they risk to be outcompeted. 

Better user retention strategies reduce churn and support the profit of Saas companies. 

Native advertising
The list of SaaS trends would be incomplete if we didn’t mention this one. Native advertising is a very appreciated form of advertising as it is less intrusive than banner ads and it addresses users in a way that they are not bothered.

Companies are expected to invest  in native advertising up to $98.59 billion in 2023. This form of advertising helps not only Saas developers to reach more of their targeted audience but also potential customers find the Saas app they need. Over 68%  of potential clients prefer native ads in an editorial context rather than social media ads which are appreciated by 55% of consumers.

This type of advertising includes ads on a website in a way that they blend in with the theme and the topic of the platform. So, when users see the ads, they feel like they are part of the website rather than a complete foreign party.

Why it matters: Native advertising is leading to more leads and more sales.  

SaaS large companies
The SaaS market is on the rise with over 89% of companies choosing to use Saas platforms over data centers and segmented applications. In the US alone 6.250 data centers have already closed by August, 2018 and another 1.200 are expected to close in 2023.

However, even with the emergence of micro SaaS and tailored vertical SaaS solutions, the market features some major players that block the growth of promising young SaaS companies. Big famous names like Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Intuit, Atlassian, Zoom lead this list of major players. They offer software for enterprises and small & medium sized companies that dominate the market nowadays. 

A list with market capitalization of the largest SaaS companies in 2021-2022
Workday - $66.3B. zoom - $94.3B. Snowflake - $94.3B. Atlassian - $95B. Square - $112.9B. Servicenow - $127.9B. Intuit - $154.9B. Shopify - $185.4B. Salesforce - $251.8 B. Adobe - $315B. 
Source: clockwise
Oracle CEO Mark Hurd expects that SaaS market consolidation will stay a sustainable SaaS trend in coming years. There are two reasons for this: it’s easier for big companies to acquire a small promising company than to compete with it. Like Zoom made with Solvyy in 2022. The second reason is the expectation of enterprise-size companies that shift to SaaS solutions since they are looking to reduce their number of vendors and are in search of an all-encompassing solution or so-called “SaaS suite”. 

Why it matters: Small and medium-sized SaaS providers will struggle to compete on the market.


Most Businesses Use at Least One SaaS Service
The notoriety of Saas is growing constantly, with over  88% businesses using at least 1 cloud computing service, according to an O’Reilly survey of 1.283 software engineers and business representatives.

The last two years affected by the pandemic may have negatively impacted a lot of industries but it helped Saas trends get a boost on the market.


People started working from home and thus, they needed better applications to communicate and manage their projects and tasks. So, many companies turned their attention towards Saas solutions and were pleasantly impressed by their efficiency.

Estimations suggest that by 2025, businesses will use Saas as 85% of their software. These estimations also consider the fact that the growth of Saas was steady since 2015. 

Why it matters: The more organizations will use Saas as part of their software, the more the importance of Saas will grow and it will become a must-have software in any type of company, which means more clients for Saas providers. 


White-Label SaaS Becomes Popular
It’s quite a new SaaS trend. White-label solutions are software that was produced by one company without a specific label or brand so that another company can buy it and brand them as it wants. The Unlayer platform is a great example for the design of landing pages and emails. If you’re searching for a SaaS platform for marketing, ActiveCampaign could be it and Sendible is a suitable white-label SaaS solution for social media.

Some of these solutions are also customizable so they will seem even more native to the business that bought them, like Epom DSP for programmatic advertising. Furthermore, the company can keep the white-label Saas solution for its use or resell it under its brand. 

Why it matters: SaaS models continue to develop in various directions. White-label solutions is one of them. 

White label is a partnership in which one company produces a product and the other sells it under its own brand. Each participant in the transaction fulfills their obligations. This format establishes the mass production of consumer goods. The main advantage is that the product enters the market under various brands and at different prices.

The most popular format of interaction is between the seller and the manufacturer. The manufacturer hands over the product to the seller. And the latter provides financial and marketing resources for the promotion and sale of goods/services. This is how two of the same goods appear on the market. 

This collaboration is good for both sides of the contract. The seller builds up the customer audience and gets additional profits. The producer creates a product with low production prices, minimizes costs of marketing and advertising, and pays for the services of related specialists.

White labeling in SaaS helps entrepreneurs enhance their branding without extra costs on infrastructure or development. Among the famous SaaS white labeling companies, there are:



API Services Evolve into SaaS
API stands for Application Programming Interface and it is based on the simple idea of ensuring communication between two or more systems. To this basic function, other features are added such as file sharing, voice recording, and group chatting and the API becomes a Saas solution and is marketed as such. 

Saas companies started to adopt this path of converting API programs into Saas solutions and branding them, within the last year. 

Why it matters: Existing API solutions can be a great base for developing Saas apps. 


Constant Improvement of Integration Between Cloud and On-Premise Systems
This SaaS trend closes our list. Saas integration represents the capability of the app to be linked to other systems to share information like clients, statuses, quantity, price, payment details, etc. 

Integration capabilities of Saas apps remain a definitory aspect for any high-quality Saas company to consider when launching such an app. A Saas program with good integration capabilities will eliminate the need for a third party, as the Saas application will offer opportunities by default. 

Proper integration also reduces the possibility of a human error occurring and use automatic procedures to support the user’s needs. 

Why it matters: Integration with other cloud and on-premise systems allow SaaS solutions to cover more clients needs and attract more users to cloud solutions. Providing a cloud ecosystem rather than a single software thanks to integration is essential here.


ChatGPT 

Question: What are the Market-Defining Saas Trends for 2023-25?

Answer:
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: With the increasing availability of data and the need for businesses to make data-driven decisions, the use of AI and machine learning in SaaS solutions is likely to become more widespread. SaaS companies may integrate AI and ML capabilities into their products to improve automation, personalization, and predictive analytics.

Low-Code/No-Code Development: The demand for faster, more agile software development is driving the growth of low-code and no-code platforms. These platforms allow non-technical users to build and deploy custom applications without the need for extensive programming knowledge. SaaS companies may offer low-code or no-code solutions to make application development more accessible and efficient.

Cloud-Native Architecture: Cloud-native architecture is becoming increasingly popular for SaaS applications as it offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. SaaS companies may adopt a cloud-native approach to their product development and delivery to meet the growing demand for cloud-based solutions.

Vertical-Specific Solutions: As the SaaS market becomes more competitive, companies may differentiate themselves by offering vertical-specific solutions tailored to specific industries or niches. These solutions may provide industry-specific features, integrations, and workflows that address the unique needs of a particular market.

Collaborative Tools: With remote work becoming more prevalent, collaboration tools have become essential for teams to communicate and work effectively. SaaS companies may offer collaborative tools that allow for seamless communication, project management, and document sharing.


Question: What are common pain points for saas industry marketing?



Answer:

The SaaS industry is highly competitive, and marketing these products can be challenging. Some common pain points that SaaS companies may face when it comes to marketing include:

Targeting the Right Audience: SaaS companies need to identify their target audience and create messaging that resonates with them. However, it can be difficult to determine who the ideal customer is, which can result in ineffective marketing efforts.

Communicating Value Proposition: SaaS companies need to clearly communicate their product's value proposition to potential customers. However, it can be challenging to differentiate their product from competitors and effectively communicate the benefits.

Converting Leads to Sales: SaaS companies often have complex sales cycles that require multiple touchpoints before a prospect converts into a customer. It can be challenging to create a sales funnel that effectively nurtures leads and moves them towards a sale.

Retaining Customers: Customer churn is a significant challenge for SaaS companies. It can be difficult to keep customers engaged and satisfied with the product, especially as competitors offer similar solutions.

Scaling Marketing Efforts: As SaaS companies grow, they need to scale their marketing efforts to reach a broader audience. However, it can be challenging to do this without losing the personal touch that initially attracted customers to the product.

To overcome these challenges, SaaS companies may need to invest in targeted marketing strategies, develop clear messaging, create effective sales funnels, focus on customer retention, and use marketing automation to scale their efforts.

1. AI Algorithms to Enhance Security of SaaS
AI technologies jump on the bandwagon of fighting cyberattacks. Kevin Skapinets, a Vice President of Strategy and Design at IBM Security, thinks that AI algorithms are helpful in detecting and predicting the common patterns of threats. So, how can Artificial Intelligence be at hand? By implementing this technology, it’s possible to identify malware and ransomware attacks before they enter a software system development. Automation is another advantage of AI in strengthening data security for SaaS. Oracle, a US computer technology giant, applied this trend to its services and expanded one of them — Cloud Access Security Broker. As a result, developers managed to fasten the process of threat detection with AI algorithms.

2. The Boom of SaaS Products for Remote Work
According to TechCrunch, there are many great SaaS tools on the market that might get new usage now as the novel coronavirus outbreak continues to spread into new regions of the world. Let’s mention some software development instruments that will be at your fingertips when you work from home. Need to organize a webinar, conference, or business meeting? By installing Zoho or other SaaS-based products on your device, you’ll manage it without a hitch! With Zoho, you can conduct a 40-minute meeting with 100 participants for free. How about communication? Slack, MatterMost and many other SaaS tools will help you to keep in touch with your teammates and make sure everything is on track.

3. White Labelling in SaaS
White label is a partnership in which one company produces a product and the other sells it under its own brand. Each participant in the transaction fulfills their obligations. This format establishes the mass production of consumer goods. The main advantage is that the product enters the market under various brands and at different prices.

The most popular format of interaction is between the seller and the manufacturer. The manufacturer hands over the product to the seller. And the latter provides financial and marketing resources for the promotion and sale of goods/services. This is how two of the same goods appear on the market. 

This collaboration is good for both sides of the contract. The seller builds up the customer audience and gets additional profits. The producer creates a product with low production prices, minimizes costs of marketing and advertising, and pays for the services of related specialists.

White labeling in SaaS helps entrepreneurs enhance their branding without extra costs on infrastructure or development. Among the famous SaaS white labeling companies, there are:

Weblium, a website constructor
AppInstitute platform for app development;
Flywheel — a web hosting platform.
4. The Growth of Low-Code Platforms
Low-code is a method of designing and developing applications using intuitive graphical tools and built-in features that reduce traditional (professional) code-writing requirements. Professional programming remains part of the process, but low-code development supports an augmented and simplified experience that ordinary users can quickly master. 

The low-code platform market will continue to evolve in the future. In 2022, its annual growth is estimated at $21.2 billion, which is 40%. A product manager from Zoho Creator, Tejas Gadhia, mentions that most of the productivity tools for employees will be low-code. By the way, low-code platforms are beneficial for developers to create drag-and-drop interfaces and integrations flawlessly. High productivity and faster iteration are among the numerous benefits low-code platforms deliver. Here are several examples of low-code platforms as a service used by companies to optimize their working operations:

Kissflow — a SaaS workflow management instrument;
Mendix — an app development platform;
Salesforce — a cloud platform computing service that offers CRM solutions.
5. The Emergence of Vertical SaaS
The vertical SaaS model focuses on the specific needs of a single industry in contrast to the horizontal one. Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, and many other renowned companies started as horizontal SaaS products. But they changed their marketing approach and implemented the vertical SaaS model to attract more clients and grow profit.

All business owners realize the importance of positioning their companies as industry leaders. That’s why more and more entrepreneurs are now using a vertical SaaS model, which is more industry-oriented than a horizontal one. Not only the business sees a vertical SaaS model as an opportunity – investing companies do the same by funding successful ventures. Have you heard about Meicai – a Chinese platform as a service that connects vegetable farmers with restaurants? Tiger Global Management and Hillhouse Capital, a US investment firm, gave between $600-800 million to this venture in 2018.

6. The Rise of MicroSaaS
A microSaaS is a small instrument developed by one person or a group of people to improve the functionalities of existing micro SaaS products like adds-on, extensions, and so on. So, why is microSaaS trendy? It helps business owners outpace key competitors and find a unique niche in the market.

The other benefit of microSaaS products is that they don’t need additional overhead from outside investment companies. Have a look at well-known companies that applied the microSaaS approach – Grammarly, an online editing tool, and Social Sprout, a social media software instrument. Both of them have $200 million and $111.5 million of total funding respectively, and they still occupy leading positions in their fields.

7. The Need for API connections
Businesses seek to provide well-integrated modern solutions to their services without creating a new IT ecosystem. That is why SaaS products must have more APIs to ensure data will be seamlessly integrated with existing IT infrastructure. LITSLINK’s high-end software development follows this approach to provide top-notch SaaS and cloud app platform services.

Daniel Levine, a business partner at Accel, believes that APIs tremendously impact SaaS development as they help ensure high extensibility and seamless integration. Have a look at Stripe and Plaid. Stripe, an online payment platform for running businesses online, focused on the API-first approach and generated over $22 billion. Plaid is a platform that connects banking data and accounts with apps. In 2019, the company collected $2.5 billion.

8. Product-Led Growth (PLD)
It’s a go-to-market tactic that relies on a product to acquire, retain, and engage clients. How can SaaS companies use this approach? They focus on consumer-like virality components for their product feature set and ensure hassle-free sign-up that doesn’t require a credit card for setting up an account. MailChimp, Slack, and Dropbox use this strategy to engage their clients and attract new ones. So, will a product-led growth method be popular in the SaaS market? Sure, it is expected to gather steam soon. HarshiCorp, which specializes in cloud automation infrastructure, successfully applied this trend. With this strategy in mind, the company increased its value to $1.9 billion and gained 45 million downloads.

9. Migration to PaaS
The SaaS market is in high gear of competition that leads companies to look for new ways to improve their products. PaaS (platform-as-a-service) is often an appealing option for companies in terms of product development and customer retention. Thus, many of them choose to migrate to scale their products further.

So, what are the key benefits of PaaS? In terms of the development process, PaaS is characterized as a highly scalable, agile, and fast alternative to SaaS. For businesses, it’s easy to build custom applications as add-ons to their main to ensure their superior flexibility. Box and Salesforce, SaaS-based market leaders, have recently followed this trend and migrated to PaaS By doing that, SaaS vendors strive to enhance client retention and increase demand for their services.

10. Mobile-First Approach in SaaS
As the name implies, the mobile-first strategy involves designing a website interface primarily focused on mobile devices. The philosophy behind this approach is that first, a prototype design is created for the smallest screen, and then developers move on to larger displays. This is the main difference from the classic desktop-first approach, which web professionals have been using for years.

According to the figures from Statista, the number of unique mobile users was 4 billion in 2019. As of January 2021, there were 4.18% unique mobile users and 4.54% active Internet users in the world. The number of mobile users is still increasing, which forces SaaS companies to adapt their services to mobile devices. Dropbox, Skype, and many other renowned companies implemented the mobile-first approach in their business models. SaaS-based project management and communication tools like Trello, Jira, and MatterMost have mobile versions as well.

Dispelling 3 Common SaaS Myths
To offer you a full and panoramic understanding of the impact software-as-a-service is having on the professional world, and get the best context of the latest SaaS trends, here, we will dispel the three most common SaaS myths – consider them busted:

SaaS tools offer just one application: On the contrary, SaaS tools range in form and function as much as any other type of software available today, so you can build a SaaS dashboard tool or use a SaaS-based email marketing solution, for example.
SaaS is less robust and less secure than on-premises applications: Despite some SaaS-based teething problems or technical issues reported by the likes of Google, these occurrences are incredibly rare with software-as-a-service applications – and there hasn’t been one major compromise of a SaaS operation documented to date.
IT professionals are anti-SaaS: Again, this is a complete myth, and like any disruptive development worth its salt, some IT professionals are reluctant to embrace SaaS as a concept. There are a large number of experts who recognize SaaS for ridding them of the day-to-day humdrum of traditional software while helping them better manage their own IT operations. This quote from Apple’s prolific founder, Steve Jobs, sums up the common view of SaaS from a technical professional’s perspective: “I don’t need a hard disk in my computer if I can get to the server faster…carrying around these non-connected computers is byzantine by comparison.”

SaaS: The Key Characteristics
Before we explore our essential software-as-a-service trends for 2023, it’s important to consider what defines SaaS as not only technological development but as a working business model.

Flexible payment options: Businesses don’t have to go through the expense of purchasing software and hardware. Instead, they have the option of utilizing various pricing structures. Flexibility in payment models, where they only pay for the resource usage they need, for instance, is attractive for many organizations in today’s competitive world.
Scalability: Cloud-based SaaS enables organizations to expand with ease due to its inherent scalability. Companies can be selective about the types of features and options they want.
Updates: SaaS providers handle the necessary software updates and develop new features over time, so businesses don’t have to invest ample amounts of time in this particular area of operation.
Accessibility: With SaaS, companies have the mobility of accessing applications from any digital device and location, making it especially convenient for mobile platforms. Additionally, it boasts ease of use and is user-friendly.
Adaptability: Due to the seemingly limitless level of scalability, accessibility, and insight SaaS innovations offer, companies that use such tools or platforms will become far more adaptable to constant change or unforeseen organizational roadblocks.
Increased collaboration: SaaS developments enhance a business’s ability to promote collaboration across teams and departments due to the facilitation of file sharing, in addition to distinct ease of reading and understanding across systems.
Security: Most SaaS models are known for their enterprise-level security, which is a more holistic approach to security than many centralized, on-premise solutions. In Cloud SaaS, pre-existing disaster recovery protocols are in place to manage potential system failures. This means that your business’s data is available and secure regardless of a data breach or system failure.
As businesses continue to rely on innovative data discovery tools and technologies to increase both their productivity and their efficiency, and as new software-as-a-service trends continue to emerge, this young, groundbreaking industry can only go from strength to strength.

Even if figures diverge somewhat, the many forecasts conducted on SaaS industry trends 2023 demonstrate an obvious reality: the SaaS market is going to get bigger and bigger. Indeed, according to Bloomberg, public cloud platforms, business services, and applications (SaaS) will all grow at a 9% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) between 2020 and 2023, and worth $60.36 billion. A Betterbuys report reveals that the specific expenditure in the U.S. SaaS Industry is forecasted to reach $55 billion by 2026. And according to Gartner, the global public cloud service market is projected to grow significantly in 2023 and beyond.

Without further ado, let's dive into the most important trends of the SaaS industry for the coming year!

The Top 12 SaaS Trends in 2023
Top 10 SaaS trends for 2022: 1. Artificial Intelligence, 2. Machine learning, 3. SaaS security as a priority, 4. Vertical SaaS, 5. Data-as-a-service, 6. The growing need for API connections, 7. Migration to PaaS, 8. Focus on retention & churn, 9. SaaS market consolidation, 10. More SaaS superapps to emerge, 11. Low-code capabilities, 12. Centralized Analytics
Now that we’ve explored the key characteristics of software-as-a-service innovations, it’s time to take a deep dive into the top SaaS trends in 2023.

From the introduction of artificial intelligence to enhanced mobile optimization and beyond, these SaaS trends 2023 will shape the sector in the dawning of the new year.

1) Artificial Intelligence
The first of our most impactful trends in SaaS is the autonomous, self-learning variety.

Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is deep-rooted in the veins of our society. AI made the top 3 of our list of business intelligence trends for 2023 – and in the coming year, it’s expected to make some serious waves. Artificial Intelligence technology is fast becoming a standard SaaS industry fixture. Autonomous innovations empower organizations across industries with the ability to drive greater product, service, or content personalization while gaining a deeper, data-driven understanding of the needs of their audience. The perfect storm of more return for less input means that with AI, businesses can become more efficient and more intelligent with fewer resources.

AI technology saw some significant developments in 2022, and now, it's set to become a real game-changer, with a projected market value of $733.7 billion by 2027. 

Within business scenarios, artificial intelligence (as well as machine learning, in many cases) provides an advanced degree of responsiveness and interaction between businesses, customers, and technology, driving AI-based SaaS trends in 2023 to a new level.

There are numerous features developed by modern software providers based on artificial intelligence, such as data alerts. With an AI algorithm using the most advanced neural network for anomaly detection, and a machine-learning algorithm for pattern recognition, these data alerts learn from trends and patterns and let you know as soon as something important happens.

That way, when a pre-set goal is met, or when something unexpected happens, you will be notified, enabling you to keep continuous control over your business. Since it is often easy to lose track of what really matters when so many KPIs have to be monitored, an online reporting tool will safely keep an eye on your data and anticipate any fluctuation and change – and alert you when it veers off course.

Artificial intelligence is likely to disrupt the SaaS landscape in a variety of ways, improving the key characteristics of the SaaS model across the board. When SaaS is combined with AI capabilities, it enables businesses to obtain better value from their data, automate and personalize services, improve security, and supplement human capacity.

How will AI help to build a shining SaaS future?

Personalization: Software is easier to use with technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), which automatically processes human speech patterns and voice control. This can be deployed across customer service functionality to improve customization and better address client needs.
Speed: Artificial intelligence-enabled SaaS speeds up internal processes and operations, allowing organizations to obtain fast answers to questions, make quick forecasts, and speed up their overall level of responsiveness.
Security: Due to artificial intelligence-enabled automation, and the ability of machine learning to recognize patterns, SaaS security is enhanced by the quick identification and remedy of potential threats with built-in self-recovery.
Data Intelligence: The sophistication of modern SaaS-based AI platforms means that it’s possible to investigate emerging consumer intents, interests, and behaviors while consolidating invaluable data from various sources and cleaning as well as segmenting it in a way that offers optimum organizational value.
Integrations: In 2023, we’re likely to see AI technologies integrate with a broader range of software types. As a result, it’s possible to create highly value-driven infrastructures that offer business-boosting value across almost every internal function or department imaginable. 
All things considered, it is not a surprise that AI will position itself as one of the most relevant SaaS future trends for 2023. As seen through the points we just mentioned above, AI is helping revolutionize the SaaS landscape in a number of ways. By extracting autonomous insights that can be applied across several areas including customer experience, product development, financial predictions, and much more, SaaS providers are able to improve their offers and use AI technologies to become more intelligent and successful with less effort and money.  

For 2023 and beyond, we will see significant growth in AI-focus software as well as the introduction of AI technologies and features into existing SaaS solutions as a way to improve their overall functionality. As more and more software adopts it, more feedback will be gathered leaving developers with enough insight to keep generating innovative AI-powered solutions. We will definitely be keeping an eye on it for the coming year!

2) Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, is utilized in SaaS to automate responsiveness in customer service reports and applications, such as AI-powered chat operations with live chatbots. It will also automate the onboarding process of SaaS. As ML is built on an autonomous operational model, new innovations will facilitate software and platforms that empower businesses to automate significant chunks of internal operations other than customer service or experience alone.

A fresh injection of ML innovation will empower SaaS-style offerings to become self-improving, offering a level of intelligence and operational efficiency that will drive a host of industries forward.

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing segments of software and, as such, it’s a hot SaaS 2023 topic. As ML becomes an integral part of the AI-based software-as-a-service model, an increasing number of platforms will emerge that will help businesses across sectors:

Train their software to learn from every task or interaction, gaining a greater level of intelligence and efficiency in the process.
Dig deeper into contextual data and insights - the kind that can help you gain a real competitive edge.
Improve internal collaboration and operations through more sophisticated communication models.
Enhance consumer communications and service output by continually adjusting language, tone of voice, and practical functions in line with the ever-changing needs and demands of clients, partners, or customers.
On a highly-commercial level, Netflix’s personalized content suggestions and Waymo’s self-driving cars that calculate increasing potential risk factors or journey hold-ups over time are examples of ML in SaaS-type models. As we enter 2023, these innovations will prove to be the tip of the automation iceberg.

3) SaaS security as a priority 
During 2022 we saw multiple data breaches and cybersecurity attacks that left huge security concerns for the coming year. These concerns permeate industries and businesses across the globe, where many organizations are turning to new technologies and processes to ensure a secure environment across the board. This is something that will rule the SaaS market in 2023 as the cloud is still subjected to various security threats and risks that need to be addressed. 

According to Adaptive Shield’s latest SaaS security report, SaaS misconfiguration is reported as one of the main security issues for cloud businesses since 2019. In fact, 63% of respondents said that SaaS misconfiguration led to a security incident in the past year, citing a lack of visibility into changes in the SaaS security settings and too much departmental access to these settings as two of the main causes for this issue. 

In that sense, the report advises organizations to rely on automation tools to tackle these misconfiguration issues as soon as they occur. But not just that. Automation is expected to come as a great solution for security teams that are feeling an increasing burden over maintaining SaaS security. That said, only 26% of surveyed organizations use this type of technology. The rest still rely on manual work to assess security and remediate misconfigurations. Leaving them exposed as manual checks can usually be carried out monthly and misconfiguration issues can go undetected for weeks before being caught.  

As a solution, the use of SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) is the path to follow. SSPM tools provide automated continuous monitoring of SaaS applications to minimize configuration and security issues and stay compliant. Software-as-a-Service companies that rely on SSPM can reduce the impact of a security breach by performing security configuration checks in real time. The chart below shows a comparison between companies using the technology and those that don’t.  

Frequency of SaaS security configuration checks for providers using SSPM compared to those who don't - from Adaptive Shield report
**Source: Adaptive Shield** 

 Misconfiguration is just one of the multiple security concerns that are being discussed in the SaaS industry. Among some other issues, we can find the growing number of apps connected to a company’s SaaS environment as another potential threat. These apps are often connected by employees without the awareness of the IT or security team, granting access permissions to corporate data that leaves the organization exposed. All of this makes investing in security a top priority for SaaS businesses that want to thrive in 2023. 

4) Vertical SaaS
Our fourth forecast for SaaS trends in 2023 is Vertical SaaS. Whereas Horizontal SaaS focuses on clients across any sector and industry, Vertical SaaS is completely customizable, targeting clients within specific industries and supply chains. 

Some examples are healthcare analytics, retail analytics, or modern logistics analytics software. Companies who are looking to benefit from specialization are finding Vertical SaaS to be a cost-effective, industry-specific option that allows them to refine the customization of certain features.

Why are Vertical SaaS trends going to have such an impact in 2023?

Vertical SaaS providers also have the ability to adapt features according to client demand and industry, and effectively address customer needs within their niche. This results in more flexibility, upselling opportunities, and lower customer acquisition costs.

These developing Vertical SaaS trends also provide the following benefits:

Customer intelligence: Enables businesses to obtain industry-specific customer data and intelligence, which plays a critical role in gaining customer-focused insights.
Pre-defined metrics and KPIs: It is already integrated with pre-defined metrics, KPIs, and analytics that businesses can utilize to assess and address daily and long-term processes and performance.
Business value: Software is designed to meet industry requirements; therefore, it provides a higher degree of business value for company operations and performance.
Improved data governance: Vertical SaaS is positioned to address data governance procedures via the inclusion of industry-specific compliance capabilities, which has the additional benefit of providing increased transparency.
New niches: As the demand for vertical SaaS solutions continues to trend upward, incredibly niche products and solutions will enter the market to address very specific industry pain points. Recently, a childcare management app launched and was so valuable it raised millions in funding almost immediately.  
A higher standard: Higher quality service from industry-specific Vertical SaaS providers will continue to emerge as each developer aims to distinguish itself from the ever-increasing crowd. Increased competition will force SaaS providers in the vertical arena to meet the needs of their users head-on, which will spawn a host of innovative niche solutions.
What makes vertical SaaS tools so interesting today is the fact that they provide smaller businesses with the necessary features to make their work more efficient. In some cases, horizontal solutions which are made to “fit all” don’t offer specific functionalities because they will not serve the majority of their users, and the ones who do offer them, might charge extra for them. That scenario has led some smaller or more industry-specific organizations to rely on vertical solutions to manage their daily operations in a more efficient and targeted way. 

In fact, according to research by Forrester Consulting, around 89% of executives and IT leaders agree that vertical SaaS is the way of the future. That, paired with the growing online business landscape left after the pandemic, has turned the eyes of investors and venture capitalists to more niche solutions. 

All things considered, for 2023, we should expect to see more vertical SaaS solutions emerge with the support of new investors that are targeting unaddressed niche markets. Definitely, one of the most interesting SaaS adoption trends for the coming year! 

5) Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) 
In the past years, companies of all sizes have been using data to inform their most important strategic decisions. This growth, paired with the new business landscape left after the pandemic, has turned the use of data into a necessity rather than a choice. However, collecting and storing data in-house has become unproductive and less secure. That is where Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) comes into the picture, positioning itself as one of the top SaaS trends for 2023. 

Essentially, DaaS is a term used to describe cloud-based software for data management processes such as data collection, storage, integration, and analytics, among others. Through this, organizations are able to reduce the time it takes to make important strategic and operational decisions and increase the quality and reliability of their data in the process. Plus it significantly decreases the time and costs of setting up data tools and processes across the organization as cloud-based software is way easier to set up than on-premise ones. 

As with all other SaaS-based disciplines, DaaS offers users secure on-demand access no matter their location or device. Something that proved to be especially useful during COVID-19, as organizations struggled to collaborate in online environments. These conditions positively impacted the global DaaS market which is expected to grow by $56.85 billion during 2023-2027, accelerating at a CAGR of 36.92%. 

As the market becomes more competitive, in 2023, DaaS tools will continue to work in developing new features that will make the use of data more efficient and secure for companies across industries. ReportLinkers’ DaaS global market report cites data-as-a-service in blockchain technology as one of the main market drivers for the next years paired with a growing need for predictive analytics. Software such as datapine offer easy access to multiple BI features including dashboarding, predictive analytics powered by artificial intelligence, real-time data access, report sharing, and much more. 

As good as this all sounds, DaaS providers will also face challenges that need to be addressed to offer quality products. Among them, we can find security at the top of the list. Given that DaaS requires users to transfer sensitive data it is necessary to use encryption technologies to protect the data. 

As of today, experts position companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, and Google as key players in the DaaS industry. However, starting in 2023 and beyond, we can expect this market to grow exponentially presenting an opportunity for smaller companies as well.

6) The Growing Need for API Connections
The API (Application Programming Interface) has been a fundamental part of software development for years, and this is precisely what our fifth SaaS trend focuses on. With the explosion of SaaS solutions and adoption by the market, the need to integrate them into an existing business system appeared. Some companies may want to migrate all their data to a cloud platform, but many actually would rather harmonize it with their already existing infrastructure in order to improve it – and this is where the problem lies.

An abstract picture of cloud connecting various technologies
At first, SaaS providers didn’t come with a complete integration solution. That failure served to complicate the work and caused them to disappoint their customers as a result. They would then redirect their clients to a third party to supply the specific APIs enabling the customer to integrate the cloud solution into their existing system. It was indeed better for the SaaS developers not to reinvent the wheel, and to win some precious time and resources relying on third-party APIs. Their go-to-market time frame was shorter, and they could focus on their core capabilities to develop differentiated functionality.

However, more and more SaaS vendors tend to provide greater integration capabilities instead of redirecting their customers to third parties.

If you are looking to invest in a cloud vendor’s services, you should ask the following questions beforehand to ensure a seamless integration:

What capabilities is the provider offering me to integrate the SaaS within my existing business system?
Can this provider also integrate the legacy systems I use?
Is my data protected while the integration process is worked through?
7) Migration to PaaS
As the software-as-a-service industry evolves and innovation increases, many developers or providers will focus on customer retention on top of customer acquisition.

That said, in 2023, we expect to see SaaS migrate further towards the realms of PaaS (platform as a service) – developments that empower businesses to build custom apps as add-ons to their original services. The likes of Salesforce and Box have recently launched PaaS-centric services in a bid to hold a strong market share in their niche, and we expect to see this SaaS trend become all the more prevalent this coming year.

One of the major focuses of the PaaS evolution in 2023 will be helping startups and relatively new ventures scale successfully at speed.

A good case study is the one of the UK-based food delivery app Deliveroo. They used Amazon’s AWS tools to help expand its geographical reach while gaining an edge over its direct competitors by using a raft of in-built platform features. The app’s expansion plans proved a success, with more planned for 2023. This is a testament to the growing power of PaaS. 

To put the relevance of this trend into perspective, here are three key advantages of using a PaaS development:

Agility: The enhanced features, functionality, and ability to customize will enhance your overall business agility, giving you more time and creative space to innovate and focus on your core commercial initiatives. Tools such as datapine offer intuitive customer retention metrics and dashboards to have a centralized view of your retention data.
Scalability: PaaS offerings are, by their very nature, robust, flexible, and accessible, which means you will be able to scale your business more easily by using a platform as a service.
Security: A distinct advantage of the PaaS model is security, as the vast majority of such developments perform a host of automatic updates on a regular basis.
8) Greater focus on retention & churn
As SaaS market growth continues to accelerate, Saas platform providers are working on a wealth of ways to offer maximum value to platform users to increase retention rates and reduce churn.

This development means that many existing platforms and emerging innovations will come equipped with fully customizable features and tools that provide access to a wealth of insights designed to help businesses optimize their internal processes while meeting the needs of their customers head-on.

In addition to amplifying the inherent value of SaaS offerings, an increased focus on churn and retention will also result in the likes of personalized onboarding tutorials & videos, better mobile optimization, and advanced platform feature notifications.

From this perspective, a greater focus on retention and churn means that as a SaaS user, you have more scope to grow and evolve your business.

Conversely, if you’re a SaaS provider, by creating solutions that empower other businesses to create tools and content such as tailored tutorials, onboarding videos, or advanced features, you will tap into a segment of the market that is likely to result in an incredible level of interest, engagement, and revenue growth.

This is one of the SaaS trends that will shape the industry in 2023 and beyond, inspiring and incentivizing providers to lead with user value at the heart of their innovations, ideas, and operations.

9) SaaS market consolidation 
It is no secret that the SaaS market is more competitive than ever. This is leading big players in the industry to try and offer additional features and capabilities to their customers as a way to stay competitive and reach a wider customer base. That said, developing these additional features in-house is often too expensive and not worth the time and effort. As a solution, big players in the industry are acquiring smaller companies as a faster way to offer their customers a more complete product package and stay ahead of competitors. 

Likewise, smaller companies are turning to consolidation as a secure way to reach a wider audience and make their businesses profitable. With the market becoming more and more saturated, the chances of growing on their own become smaller, therefore, taping into the reputation and trajectory of bigger players is often the best path to follow.   

All things considered, we should expect to see multiple consolidations between companies in the SaaS market for 2023. These consolidations will not necessarily be between smaller and bigger players but between companies that can benefit from each other. In fact, in 2021, CRM giant Salesforce acquired the popular workplace software Slack for $27.7 billion. This consolidation is a win-win for both providers as Salesforce can offer improved communication capabilities to their users, while Slack can stand as a stronger figure against its biggest competitor Microsoft Teams. 

10) The emergence of SaaS superapps
As a consequence of the market consolidation we just discussed above, we can expect to see the emergence of SaaS superapps as a big trend in 2023.

As stated by Gartner in their 2023 Technology Trends Report, a supperapp is “an app that provides end users (e.g., customers, partners or employees) with a set of core features, along with access to independently created mini-apps”. It is a platform to deliver consistent and personalized app experiences that are expected to provide a huge competitive advantage to its providers.

It is important to note that a superapp is more than an application that offers multiple features and services into one interface, it is a composable application and architecture in which multiple unrelated integrations can be built into one app. 

In 2023, this trend is expected to gain traction, especially in the SaaS B2B landscape. Where businesses are expected to develop “One API for all” by unifying several APIs into one. Such is the case of Alloy Automation, a no-code integration platform with over 200+ app integrations designed to help e-commerce founders, marketers, agencies, and more, automate processes in areas such as customer management, customer service, upselling, marketing, and others. 

Another use case is with data dilution and fragmentation which is one of the most pressing problems that modern enterprises face today (particularly large companies and businesses that are scaling fast). According to studies, data ‘scattering’ or fragmentation is one of the biggest barriers to organizational growth or evolution, as it slows organizations down, creates confusion, and results in rafts of missed opportunities.

With poor data management still a widespread issue, a wealth of new SaaS providers are emerging to help businesses consolidate, organize, and access quality data (derived from a range of sources) in one centralized location or app. In addition to broadening platform integration capabilities, new concepts including document management systems and digital asset management systems are set to make their mark in 2023 and beyond.

Document management tools allow employees to access files and documents from a range of sources from one visually digestible and highly functional location such as an online dashboard. Digital asset management solutions share a similar model, except they are focused on helping businesses locate and capitalize on their most valuable branding assets from a variety of locations or sources.

Another fast-emerging data fragmentation solution comes in the form of an Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS). The concept here is to help companies connect fragmented data silos or ‘pipes’ and connect informational dots with ease - becoming more intelligent, streamlined, and successful as a result. 

iPaaS is focused on empowering companies to use their data to its optimum capabilities. It’s an industry that is forecasted to reach $10.3 billion by the year 2025 - one of the trends in SaaS to look out for over the next 12 months.

11) Low-Code Capabilities
Software-as-a-service platforms continue to expand their reach year by year and 2023 will be no exception. Particularly due to the emergence of  ‘white labeling,’ ‘no code,’ and ‘low-code’ platforms, tech startups can bring their SaaS-based content to life with less technical experience.

White labeling

SaaS white labeling will continue to grow in 2023 and is a process where a software-based business creates a fully developed, tested, and finalized platform and then sells it to another company so they can customize and sell it under their own branding. It can also be a part of white label BI tools, where companies integrate a solution within their own application.

White labeling will prove particularly valuable to startups looking to gain market share quickly and with fewer logistical or financial costs to consider. If the framework for a platform or development is available right out of the box, startups can focus on their value proposition, strategy, and branding rather than having to start from scratch. In practice, BI dashboard software can be used as a SaaS solution that is completely white-labeled and adjusted to the specific branding needs of a company or department.

Low code-evolution

Low-coding solutions are out-of-the-box style data centers (SaaS platforms for SaaS platform providers, if you will) that won’t eliminate the need for developers or engineers. 

But, having less code to write to form the foundations of your platform or solution means that technical staff or contractors can spend more time driving innovation or sweating the stuff that results in a real competitive edge. 

For example, you can implement a BI solution that is completely adjustable to your industry and department and relieve your technical team of endless supporting tasks. That way, they will have more time to focus on the development and engineering itself which will, ultimately, bring sustainable development to your business.

No code SaaS capabilities will increase productivity and bring new players to the market faster in 2023, meaning that exciting new solutions will emerge from the digital woodwork. 

Low code and no code innovations continue to develop and emerge based on rising market demand. According to a mix of studies, businesses across sectors (startups, in particular) are opting for ‘low code’ solutions for the following reasons:

To accelerate digital transformation and innovation
To reduce their current IT or technical backlog and boost responsiveness
To drive down the necessity for or dependency on hard-to-hire technical skills
To protect the business against aggressive technological churn
To improve internal processes
As one of the most all-encompassing SaaS market trends on our list, the low-code revolution is worth monitoring in 2023 - especially as new providers are rising from the digital woodwork almost every month. Oh, it’s also predicted to be worth $187 billion by 2030.

This is an exciting SaaS industry trend that is worth embracing if you’re looking to create a new platform or enhance an existing solution.

12) Centralized Analytics
The third of our essential SaaS industry trends is data-driven. As digital transformation across industries accelerates, businesses across sectors look to data to streamline their organization while gaining a deeper insight into their customers or users. Investment in analytics-driven software-as-a-service innovations is expected to soar.

In fact, industry experts believe that investment and value in analytics-centric SaaS models will rise in 2023 and beyond. Analytics will become a central component of almost every service-based software platform, making BI and data-driven decisions all the more powerful for anyone looking to get ahead of the competition.

This centralized analytics will enable users to look into their data from a single point of truth, discovering hidden insights by utilizing modern solutions such as performance dashboards, where every member of the team has access to the most vital information. 

Moreover, the centralized nature of SaaS models will enable users to access data from any device, at any time. Modern online business intelligence makes this happen with the help of advanced software capabilities and the online environment where each member of the team has access to their analytics.
